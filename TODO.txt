- create modal for options??
- get rid of current markation
- create node point



==== how to store connections? ====

each node needs to store an array of connected nodes?
- issue with repition? doubling up of data...?
- important of directionality of connection?
  - would probably cause a few issues...

   n -----> n
       &
   n <----- n

       VS

   n <----> n

   Bottom one is probably the one to go with...

   
- issue that you cant store a pointer to similar class within an
  object??

- should rework the code, so that when create a drag, a Connection
  object gets created!! Gets its position from Connector...?



=======

Think of how to edit a node...

Edit text
Edit color
Edit shape


- modal?
- sidebar as in Apple Docs?
- independent pop-up window?


- work with bootstrap modals for now, work on repositioning them to
  relative position of the node
