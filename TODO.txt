- create modal for options
- create connection class (line shape)
- mark as hovered when mousing over
- get rid of current markation
- create node point



==== how to store connections? ====

each node needs to store an array of connected nodes?
- issue with repition? doubling up of data...?
- important of directionality of connection?
  - would probably cause a few issues...

   n -----> n
       &
   n <----- n

       VS

   n <----> n

   Bottom one is probably the one to go with...

   
- issue that you cant store a pointer to similar class within an
  object??

- should rework the code, so that when create a drag, a Connection
  object gets created!! Gets its position from Connector...?



- should bring in concept of highlighted VS selected
